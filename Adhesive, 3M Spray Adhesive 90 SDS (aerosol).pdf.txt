Hazard Statements
Extremely flammable aerosol. 
Causes eye irritation. 
May cause respiratory irritation. 
May cause drowsiness or dizziness. 
May displace oxygen and cause rapid suffocation. 
Causes damage to organs: 
cardiovascular system  | 
Precautionary Statements
General:
Keep out of reach of children. 
Prevention:
Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking. 
Do not spray on an open flame or other ignition source. 
Pressurized container: Do not pierce or burn, even after use. 
Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. 
Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. 
Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product. 
Wash thoroughly after handling. 
Response:
Avoid release to the environment. 
6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
If possible, seal leaking container. Place leaking containers in a well-ventilated area, preferably an operating exhaust hood, or 
if necessary outdoors on an impermeable surface until appropriate packaging for the leaking container or its contents is 
available.  Close cylinder.  Collect as much of the spilled material as possible using non-sparking tools.  Place in a metal 
container approved for transportation by appropriate authorities.  Dispose of collected material as soon as possible.
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1. Precautions for safe handling
Keep out of reach of children.   Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking.   Do not spray on an 
open flame or other ignition source.   Do not pierce or burn, even after use.  Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray.  
Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.   Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product.   Wash thoroughly after 
handling.  Avoid release to the environment.   Avoid contact with oxidizing agents (eg. chlorine, chromic acid etc.)
7.2. Conditions for safe storage including any incompatibilities
Store in a well-ventilated place.  Keep container tightly closed.   Protect from sunlight.  Do not expose to temperatures 
exceeding 50C/122F.   Store away from heat.  Store away from acids.  Store away from oxidizing agents.

Do not remain in area where available oxygen may be reduced.  Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust 
ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. 
If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.
8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face
protection(s) are recommended:
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.
