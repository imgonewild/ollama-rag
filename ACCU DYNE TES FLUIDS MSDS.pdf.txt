5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Suitable extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical, or water spray.
Unsuitable extinguishing media: No daA available.
Special hazards arising from the substance: 2-ethoxyethanol is flammable. lt may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames. Most vapors
are heavier than air. They will spread along the ground and collect in low or confined areas.
Advice for firefighters: Wear self-contained brathing apparatus for firefighting if necessary.
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Personal precautions: Use personal protective equipment. Ensure adequate ventilation. Avoid breating vapors.
Environmental precautions: Prevent futher leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not let product enter drains.
Methods and materials fior cleaning up: Soak up witr inert absorptive material and put into a suitable chemical waste disposal
container.
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for safu handling: Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Avoid inhalation of vapor.
Conditions for safe storage: Keep botles securely closed in a dry, well-ventilated place when not in use. Avoid strong oxidizing agents.

Suitable extinguishing media: Carbon dioxide, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical, or water spray.
Unsuitable extinguishing media: No daA available.
Special hazards arising from the substance: 2-ethoxyethanol is flammable. lt may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames. Most vapors
are heavier than air. They will spread along the ground and collect in low or confined areas.
Advice for firefighters: Wear self-contained brathing apparatus for firefighting if necessary.
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Personal precautions: Use personal protective equipment. Ensure adequate ventilation. Avoid breating vapors.
Environmental precautions: Prevent futher leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not let product enter drains.
Methods and materials fior cleaning up: Soak up witr inert absorptive material and put into a suitable chemical waste disposal
container.
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for safu handling: Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Avoid inhalation of vapor.
Conditions for safe storage: Keep botles securely closed in a dry, well-ventilated place when not in use. Avoid strong oxidizing agents.
